/// Jaimini Sthira dasha — SIGN-based with FIXED durations, started from
/// Brahma's rashi.
///
/// Implementation follows Akhila Kumar, "Predicting through Jaimini's
/// Sthira Dasha" (Vani Publications; the K.N. Rao / Bharatiya Vidya
/// Bhawan method), Introduction pp. 10–27 — the same school our Chara
/// dasha follows. The book resolves each classical controversy and its
/// choices are what ship here:
///
/// - GRAHA BALA (seven grahas, never the nodes) = Mulatrikonadi bala
///   (exalted 70 / moolatrikona 60 / own 50 / friend 40 / neutral 30 /
///   enemy 20 / debilitated 10) + Amsa bala by chara-karaka rank
///   (AK 70 … DK 10) + Kendradi bala from the Atmakaraka's rashi
///   (kendra 60 / panaphara 40 / apoklima 20).
/// - RASHI BALA = the LORD's graha bala posted to the sign(s) it owns
///   (the book's "posted in their respective rashis" — verified against
///   its Nehru table, which only reproduces under lordship-posting) +
///   chara bala by modality (movable 20 / fixed 40 / dual 60) + sthira
///   bala (10 per occupying graha) + drishti bala: 60 each for the
///   sign's lord, for Jupiter, and for Mercury either SITTING IN the
///   sign or casting Rashi Drishti onto it. The three channels are
///   independent — Jupiter lording Sagittarius from Sagittarius scores
///   both the lord 60 and the Jupiter 60 (book's Dhanu row: 120).
/// - BRAHMA: from the stronger of lagna/7th by rashi bala, the strongest
///   by graha bala among that sign's 6th, 8th and 12th lords; Saturn is
///   simply rejected (the book states the "count the 6th from there"
///   exception only to discard it as circular). Rahu/Ketu never
///   compete — they hold no graha bala and lord nothing here.
/// - RUDRA: the stronger by graha bala of the 2nd and 8th lords from
///   lagna (P.S. Shastri's single Rudra). MAHESHWARA: the 8th lord from
///   the Atmakaraka's rashi. Saturn may be either; only Brahma bars it.
/// - THE DASHA: mahadashas run from Brahma's rashi, always DIRECT, all
///   twelve signs; durations are fixed by modality — movable 7, fixed 8,
///   dual 9 years — with no balance at birth. Antardashas start from the
///   mahadasha's OWN sign, direct, in twelve equal parts (the book's
///   uniform 7/8/9 months, set by the maha sign's modality — its three
///   worked antardasha tables all confirm uniform-per-maha, against a
///   misreadable sentence in the intro). Pratyantars repeat the same
///   shape from the antardasha's sign (the book's 17d12h/20d/22d12h are
///   exactly parent/12); deeper levels generalize identically.
///
/// One inference is ours, marked in [_mulatrikonadiBala]: the book shows
/// debilitation degrading past the deep-fall degree (its Example 3 Sun in
/// Libra 14°41' scores 20, "Exceeds Deepest debilitation point") and
/// exaltation holding up to the deep point; the symmetric case — an
/// exaltation sign PAST the deep degree — has no worked example and
/// falls through to the relationship tiers here.
