/// Jaimini Chara dasha — SIGN-based, not nakshatra-based (brief §2.3).
/// Derived from the ascendant and each sign's lord placement, so its
/// input shape differs from Vimshottari/Yogini — but it emits the same
/// period-tree output.
///
/// Implementation follows K.N. Rao, "Predicting through Jaimini's Chara
/// Dasha" (Vani Publications), chapters 3, 4 and 6. Two DISTINCT
/// direct/indirect groupings are in play and must not be conflated:
///
/// - ORDER grouping (ch. 3, from the 9th house of each rashi): Aries,
///   Leo, Virgo, Libra, Aquarius, Pisces are "direct lagna" rashis —
///   their mahadasha sequence runs zodiacally forward, the remaining
///   six run backward. The same grouping (of the running mahadasha
///   rashi) sets the antardasha direction (ch. 4).
/// - COUNTING grouping (ch. 6): Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Libra, Scorpio,
///   Sagittarius count forward from themselves to their lord; the rest
///   count backward. Inclusive count minus one = dasha years; lord in
///   its own rashi → 12 years (so years span 1–12, never 0).
///
/// Sub-periods (ch. 4): the 12 rashis from the one AFTER the mahadasha
/// rashi, own rashi LAST, each an equal 1/12 of the parent.
///
/// Scorpio (Mars/Ketu) and Aquarius (Saturn/Rahu) dual lordship
/// (ch. 6 special rules): a co-lord placed in the rashi itself is
/// ignored and the count goes to the other; both in the rashi → 12
/// years; both outside → the stronger one counts (more planets
/// associated, then higher degrees in sign).
