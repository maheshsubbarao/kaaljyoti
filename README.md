Free & open-source Vedic astrology app — high calculation precision (Swiss Ephemeris), a deeply customizable dashboard, and a consent-governed research community. Offline-first: charts are computed and stored on your device; no account is ever required to use the calculator.

**No ads. No tracking. No paid tier.** And because the code is open, you can verify all three.

## What's implemented (v1 scope)

- **Chart engine** — birth chart (Rashi/D1) + Navamsa (D9) from DOB/time/place; North Indian, South Indian and Circular styles; 47 ayanamsas (Lahiri default, per-kundli override); planetary positions, panchang at birth, yoga/dosha detection; Prashna kundli.
- **Customizable dashboard** (primary differentiator) — named views per kundli created from templates (Overview, Today, Divisional Focus, Practitioner, Blank); responsive span grid (2 columns on phones, 3 on tablets; widgets sized full/half/third per instance); long-press drag-to-rearrange on the dashboard itself; widget duplication (e.g. three Divisional Chart instances showing D3/D7/D9, or all three dasha systems side by side); per-instance config via a generic settings sheet. All driven by one widget registry — hosts never know module internals.
- **Divisional charts** — full D1–D60 varga engine (D2 Hora, D3, D4, D7, D9, D10, D12, D16, D20, D24, D27, D30 Trimshamsa, D40, D45, D60) behind one configurable Divisional Chart widget.
- **Appearance settings** (elderly-friendly) — text size 100–160%, Classic/High-contrast/Dark palettes, serif or simple headings; persisted, applied app-wide including chart painters.
- **Dasha systems** — Vimshottari, Yogini, Jaimini Chara behind a single `DashaCalculator` interface emitting a shared 3-level period tree.
- **Widget contract** (`lib/widgetsystem/astro_module.dart`) — metadata / dataSource / cardView / detailView / pdfView. Dashboard, customizer and PDF exporter all loop over the registry; a new module = one class + one registry entry.
- **PDF export/print** — module toggle list pre-checked from the dashboard, A4/Letter, cover page, optional practitioner branding, native share/print sheet. Free on every plan.
- **Offline-first storage** — SQLCipher-encrypted SQLite; passphrase in platform keystore. Personal kundlis never leave the device unless sync is enabled.
- **Mahakosh** — consent-governed contribution (self/third-party/health consent branches), anonymized charts (MK-codes), precomputed search index, AND/OR/NOT combination search, research request board with moderation queue, two-way notifications, respond-with-chart flow.
- **Accounts & sync** — Supabase auth (value-driven, never forced); opt-in per-kundli cross-device sync.
- **i18n architecture** — every user-facing string lives in `lib/l10n/app_<code>.arb`, with the Sanskrit-term policy (transliterate, don't translate) documented per key. A new language is **one file and no Dart**: it appears in Settings ▸ Language on its own, named in its own script, and PDF export embeds the right fonts by detecting the scripts in the text (20 scripts covered, Latin/Greek/Cyrillic native). Untranslated keys fall back to English, so partial translations ship fine. See [docs/adding-a-language.md](docs/adding-a-language.md). English and Hindi are complete.

Also included: **community discussions** on Mahakosh charts (report/block/moderation built in), **push notifications** (FCM as a delivery pipe only — no Firebase Analytics; entirely disabled unless you provide your own Firebase config at build time), and optional **crash reporting** (Sentry; inert without a DSN — builds you compile yourself contain no telemetry).

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amitverm/kaaljyoti.git
cd kaaljyoti
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Requires Flutter 3.27+ (Dart 3.6+). The app runs fully offline with no configuration.

### Backend (Mahakosh / auth / sync)

Follow `supabase/README.md` (create project → `supabase db push` → deploy the edge functions → set secrets), then run with:

```bash
cp env.example.json env.json   # fill in your real values (env.json is git-ignored)
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=env.json
```

(Equivalent one-off form: `--dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=... --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...`)

`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` takes the **publishable key** (`sb_publishable_...`) shown in new Supabase projects — it's the successor to the legacy anon key, with identical low privileges under RLS. Never use the secret (`sb_secret_`) / service_role key in the app.

Without these defines, Mahakosh/auth/sync screens show their signed-out/unconfigured states.

## Architecture map

```
lib/
  core/astro/        engine: sweph wrapper, snapshot, panchang, yogas,
                     divisional charts, dasha/ (3 systems + registry)
  charts/            North/South/Circular CustomPainters + ChartView
  widgetsystem/      module contract + registry (dashboard/PDF loop over it)
  modules/           7 modules: birth chart, dasha, panchang,
                     moon/nakshatra, positions, navamsa, yogas
  data/              encrypted SQLite: kundlis, dashboard views, settings
  mahakosh/          community repo client, chart index builder, research
  services/          place lookup (Open-Meteo + tz), sync
  screens/           all 15 designed screens + PDF export screen
  pdf/               exporter (loops over registry pdfViews)
  l10n/              app_<code>.arb per language + terminology policy;
                     astro_l10n.dart maps core enums -> localized text
                     (core stays pure Dart and locale-unaware)
supabase/            migrations (schema + RLS + triggers), edge functions
                     (search, matching, moderation, notification fan-out)
```

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — contributions are welcome and
require copyright assignment (this keeps the project's licensing options
open). Run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` before submitting.

Two guides for the most common contributions:

- **[Translate the app](docs/adding-a-language.md)** — add one
  `app_<code>.arb` file; no Dart, and no programming experience needed.
  Partial translations are welcome.
- **[Add a yoga](docs/adding-yogas.md)** — a rule in the detection
  engine is usually 10–25 lines plus a test.
